# `gofer-openapi`

CLI and Library to assist in converting OpenAPI Specifications into working
[Gofer][gofer] clients.

## Installation

```
$ npm i gofer-openapi
```

## CLI Usage

The basic idea is that this tool reads in an OpenAPI 3.x specification file
and outputs a TypeScript file which contains all of the required type
declarations, as well as a declaration of a class which extends `Gofer`.

You may then subclass this class to add a valid constructor as well as any
hand-written methods you wish to add.  By keeping the files separate, you
are free to regenerate the auto-generated base class as often as you need
(as the OpenAPI spec changes).

### TypeScript

```
$ npx gofer-openapi --class PetStoreBase < petstore.yml > petstore-base.ts
```

Now you can create your subclass:

```ts
// File: petstore.ts
import { PetStoreBase } from './petstore-base';

class PetStore extends PetStoreBase {
  constructor() {
    super({}, 'PetStore', '1.0.0');
  }

  addTwoDogs() {
    return this.addPet([ /* ... */ ]);
  }
}
```

And use it:

```ts
import { PetStore } from './petstore';

async function query() {
  const client = new PetStore();
  const res = await client.addTwoDogs();
  const res2 = await client.someAutoGeneratedMethod();
}
```
